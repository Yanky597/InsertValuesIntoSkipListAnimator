# Insert values into Skip List Animator

Automate the insertion of the Skip list animator found [here](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/DS/SkipList.html).
It's a simple script for adding values. I created it for the purpose of helping one of my college professors 
demonstrate Insertion into a skip list.
